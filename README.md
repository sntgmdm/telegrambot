Telegram Bot for my Rasberry Pi acting as TorrentBox

This should work as monitoring for the TorrentBox that will be unaccesible.
Plus why not some fun with Bots! :)

On my Rasberry, when updating the code I use:
#git fetch --all
#git reset --hard origin/master

this way I just have to add the chatbot TOKEN
